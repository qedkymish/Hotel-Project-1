# Hotel Reservation System
C++ implementation of a hotel reservation system that manages room inventory, reservations, and revenue tracking. The project leverages Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles such as class inheritance and polymorphism to provide a flexible and scalable solution for hotel management.

# Features:
1. Room Inventory Management: Tracks and displays the availability of four types of roomsâ€”Standard Rooms (Courtyard and Scenic), Deluxe Suites, and Penthouses.
2. Reservation System: Allows guests to reserve rooms based on type and availability.
3. Revenue Tracking: Calculates and tracks the total revenue generated from reservations.
4. getTotal() Function: Provides a summary of remaining rooms, reserved rooms, and total revenue for the day.
# Purpose
This project showcases the use of OOP concepts in C++ to solve real-world problems by efficiently managing hotel resources and reservations.
